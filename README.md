# Ray tracing.

Implement ray tracing from the sracth. It is able to generate images from intersecting spheres, boxes, planes, and meshes. (The code also parses data from XML files)
Basic shading techniques(ambient, diffuse and Blinn-Phong) are used to create color and shadow. 

Other features: super-sampling, mirror reflection, depth of field blur, perlin noise
